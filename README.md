# OpenFace 2.2.0 for aarm64

## What is it?

[OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) as docker container image for aarm64 environments.

## Motivation

The development of OpenFace stopped 5 years; nevertheless, it remains a valuable piece of software utilized in numerous research projects. OpenFace relies on outdated dependencies that pose challenges for compilation on aarm64 architecture. Therefore, I opted to develop a container that operates seamlessly on computers with ARM processors, such as the new Apple Silicon devices or AWS Graviton instances, eliminating the need of a complex compilation process and downloading large model files.


## Dependencies

It requies to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).


## Usage examples

Process multiple images from a directory:

    docker run --rm -it -v /host/input:/oface/input -v /host/processed:/oface/processed ghcr.io/juanparati/openface-aarm64:master ./FaceLandmarkImg -fdir input

Process a video file

    docker run --rm -it -v /host/input:/oface/input -v /host/processed:/oface/processed ghcr.io/juanparati/openface-aarm64:master ./FaceLandmarkVid -f input/myvideo.mp4


Replace `/host/input` with the path to the local directory that contains the input files.
Replace `/host/processed`with the path to the local directory that contains the processed files
